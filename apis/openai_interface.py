          You will receive a string in French. Please do the following to it:

          1. Translate the entire string to English.
          2. Deconstruct the french string into its constituent words in lowercase except for proper nouns.
              e.g. "Bonjour, je m'appelle Harry Potter." -> [bonjour, je, m'appelle, Harry, Potter]
          3. Deconstruct any contractions into their constituent words.
              e.g. [bonjour, je, m'appelle, Harry, Potter] -> [bonjour, je, me, appelle, Harry, Potter]
          4. Convert any verbs to their infinitive form.
              e.g. [bonjour, je, me, appelle, Harry, Potter] -> [bonjour, je, me, appeler, Harry, Potter]
          5. Add any accents that were missing in the input.
              e.g. "ecole" -> "Ã©cole"
          
          Your response should be a JSON object with the following fields:

          {
              "englishSentence": from step 1,
              "words": // an array of strings from step 5.
          }

          If for some reason you cannot complete the request, return the following:
          
          {"error": "error message"}
          
          You should generally be able to determine when to throw this error. Here are some
          concrete examples of times you should definitely return the error:
          - You receive some input that is not a French string.
          - The input is too long for you to process.
