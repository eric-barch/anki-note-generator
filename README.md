Make Anki language flashcards faster.

## When to Use

A good way to start learning a new language is to immerse yourself in a text written in that language. Making flashcards can helps ensure that a new term needs to be encountered only once for it to be added to your review pool.

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free, open-source flashcard program. Its use of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) makes it great for building and retaining a new vocabulary.

But making flashcards is time-consuming. You have to stop reading, look up the term, fill out the Anki template, then regain context and keep reading. Due to all the friction that comes with creating a single card, you end up only creating cards for terms that are 'true' vocabulary terms like nouns and adjectives. Articles and connectors often get left by the wayside.

fastcards allows you to simply type in a string from the text you're reading. It destructures the string into its component terms, tells you which terms are already in your flashcard database, and gives you the option to automatically make flashcards for the terms you don't have yet. You can make flashcards for an entire sentence in a few seconds.

## Dependencies

fastcards uses OpenAI's `chat-3.5-turbo` model to translate and tag vocabulary terms. You need to supply your own OpenAI API key.
